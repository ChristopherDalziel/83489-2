# Shape Sorter Online - Leave your shape sorting in the hands of a computer

[Deployed Site](https://shapesorteronline.netlify.app/)

This application was made in response to the challenge 'Build an application that sorts the following shapes: Circles, Triangles and Quadrilaterals.
<br />
In the future I may revisit it to create a deeper filter, which would return more shapes such as ovals, scalene triangles, etc. <br />
